        random walks - from drunk walking <br />
        to predicting baseball games
      </h1>

      <p class="normal-text">
        A random walk describes the process of a stochastic succession of
        numbers through N genearations. For each generation, the number takes a
        “step” of value r, defined by a random algorithm. That value could be
        fixed for any “direction” or it could be weighted (biased towards right
        or left, in a 1-dimensional number line). This process can be applied in
        n dimensions, but most visualizations stick to 2D or 3D.
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        Here I will present you some interactive plots, animations and a cool
        case study, showing the distribution, beauty and behavior of a simple
        random walker. Let’s start off looking at the distribution of our walker
        through a 1D space, after N generations, with a step size of r, and no
        bias, using a uniform pseudorandom number generator with the help of
        p5.js’s random() function. We will then move on to seeing some
        beautiful, creative ways of visualizing the walker in a 2D space using
        p5.js.
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        Later on, we’ll also explore other random generators, such as p5’s noise
        function, that uses Perlin noise, and how the walker behaves with
        resampling techniques, such as Monte Carlo simulations. At the end, we
        will see how can we predict the outcome of some baseball games for a
        fairly average fictional team, and we will also discuss how can we use
        random walks to guess if a process is mostly random or not.
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        Every plot in this page is interactive. Every plot and drawing can be
        controlled by a set of parameters in the boxes above them. Try them out
        and see how different sets of values control the behavior of our little
        walker fellow!
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">So, let’s get started!</p>

      <h2>a truly <em>random</em> walker</h2>

      <p class="normal-text">
        In the following examples, we will see how a 1-dimensional random walker
        behhaves after N generations, with an unhbiased step size of r, where
        the direction of r is defined by a uniform random distribution. Here I
        will let you define the values for N and r, so get to exploring!
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        P.S.: by “direction” I mean if the step r is going to be a negative
        value (to the “left” of the number line) or a positive value (to the
        “right” of the line).
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        The plot below is a line chart that shows the total “distance” d (the
        sum of the values of the steps) the walker has travelled. Note that,
        since some steps may be negative values - as we are thinking about going
        forward (+r) or backwards (-r) on a 1D number line - d can be a negative
        value.

        Yes, this plot is nice and all, but it is a bit boring. We’re gonna
        spice some things up now! First of all, do you wonder how many beautiful
        images could we come up with just by using this simple process of
        describing random events? No? Well, let me help you with that. Here is a
        simple example of how can we visualize our walker. For this, we’re gonna
        use a 2D walker instead of 1D - since 1D walkers are pretty lame for
        creative visualizations.

      <p class="normal-text">
        Wanna know how that was made? Well, our walker friend here is a line,
        connecting two points each with an x an y position in this 2D canvas. We
        iterate N times (which is 100,000 here) and, for each iteration,
        generate separate “step” values for x and y that are either -5 or 5,
        with equal probabilities. We then connect the point in the walker’s
        previous x and y positions to the new one and voilá! The colors are
        mapped to the walker’s position on the canvas, just to add a touch of
        rainbowness.
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">Now, let’s see how our walker... well, walks!</p>

      <h2>a <em>noisy</em> walker</h2>

      <p class="normal-text">
        We can use different random algorithms to control the behavior of our
        walker. For example, instead of using a uniform random distribution, we
        could use something like Perlin noise, which generates smooter random
        values. The issue here is: how do we map the generated values to our 1D
        walker’s “direction”. One simple approach is to take the value generated
        by p5.js’ noise() and use p5.js’ map() to smartly convert it to a number
        between -1 and 1. The issue here is that we we’ll generate a floating
        point number that is... well, between -1 and 1, and not either or.
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        Anoter - arguably dumber - approach, which we are gonna use here, is to
        instead use the generated number as a thresshold value. So, in our
        example, if the noise algorithm generates a number <= 0.5, the walker
        goes backwards; otherwise, it goes forward.
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        Try fiddling with the numbers! They do the same as in the previous
        iteration.

        Ok, that’s cool and all, but what about the creative visualizations? For
        this one, it is a bit more interesting. You see, since Perlin noise
        generates smooth random values, more often than not, our walker is goona
        take a large sequence of steps in the same direction. Once again, let’s
        visualize the walker in 2D, since a 1D walker is pretty lame. This time,
        let’s try it with points instead of lines, and see what we’ve got!

        Pretty interesting, right? You see that our walker walks a lot in one
        direction before taking some very smooth turns, which is expected since
        we’re using Perlin noise to control its movements. It will be easier to
        spot this trend in the animated version below, but the graph should have
        given you a good idea.
