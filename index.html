          >random walk</a
        >
        describes the process of a stochastic succession of numbers through
        <em>N</em> genearations. For each generation, the number takes a “step”
        of value <em>r</em>, defined by a random algorithm. That value could be
        fixed for any “direction” or it could be weighted (biased towards right
        or left, in a 1-dimensional number line). This process can be applied in
        <em>n</em>-dimensions, but most visualizations stick to 2D or 3D.

        Here I will present you some interactive plots, animations and a cool
        case study, showing the distribution, beauty and behavior of a simple
        <span class="red-text">random walker</span>. Let’s start off looking at
        the distribution of our walker through a 1D space, after
        <em>N</em> generations, with a step size of <em>r</em>, and no bias,
        using a uniform

        >
        with the help of <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a>’s

          >random()</a

        function. We will then move on to seeing some beautiful, creative ways
        of visualizing the <span class="red-text">walker</span> in a 2D space
        using p5.js.
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        Later on, we’ll also explore other random generators, such as p5’s
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noise" target="_blank"
          >noise()</a
        >
        function, that uses

          >Perlin noise</a
        >, and how can we extracte predictions from our
        <span class="red-text">walkers</span> when there are a lot of them. At
        the end, we will see how we can predict the outcome of some baseball
        games for a fairly average fictional team, and we will also discuss how
        can we use <span class="red-text">random walks</span> to guess if a
        process is mostly random or not.

        Every plot in this page is interactive. Every plot and drawing can be
        controlled by a set of parameters in the boxes above them. Try them out
        and see how different sets of values control the behavior of our little
        <span class="red-text">walker</span> fellow!
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">So, let’s get started!</p>

      <h2>a truly <em>random</em> walker</h2>

      <p class="normal-text">
        In the following examples, we will see how a
        <span class="red-text">1-dimensional random walker</span> behhaves after
        <em>N</em> generations, with an unhbiased step size of <em>r</em>, where
        the direction of <em>r</em> is defined by a uniform random distribution.
        Here I will let you define the values for <em>N</em> and <em>r</em>, so
        get to exploring!
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        <span class="red-text"><em>P.S.</em>:</span> by “direction” I mean if
        the step <em>r</em> is going to be a negative value (to the “left” of
        the number line) or a positive value (to the “right” of the line).
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        The plot below is a line chart that shows the total “distance”
        <em>d</em> (the sum of the values of the steps) the
        <span class="red-text">walker</span> has travelled. Note that, since
        some steps may be negative values - as we are thinking about going
        forward (+<em>r</em>) or backwards (-<em>r</em>) on a 1D number line -
        <em>d</em> can be a negative value.

        Yes, this plot is nice and all, but it's a bit boring. We’re gonna spice
        some things up now! First of all, do you wonder how many beautiful
        images could we come up with just by using this simple process of
        describing random events? No? Well, let me help you with that. Here is a
        simple example of how can we visualize our
        <span class="red-text">walker</span>. For this, we’re gonna use a 2D
        <span class="red-text">walker</span> instead of 1D - since 1D
        <span class="red-text">walkers</span> are pretty lame for creative
        visualizations.
      </p>

      <button class="simulate-button" onclick="">simulate</button>

      <div id="simulation-1" class="p5-simulation"></div>

      <p class="normal-text">
        Wanna know how that was made? Well, our
        <span class="red-text">walker</span> friend here is a line, connecting
        two points each with an <em>x</em> an <em>y</em> position in this 2D
        canvas. We iterate <em>N</em> times (which is 100,000 here) and, for
        each iteration, generate separate “step” values for <em>x</em> and
        <em>y</em> that are either -5 or 5, with equal probabilities. We then
        connect the point in the walker’s previous <em>x</em> and
        <em>y</em> positions to the new one and <em>voilá</em>! The colors are
        mapped to the walker’s position on the canvas, just to add a touch of
        <em>rainbowness</em>.
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        Now, let’s see how our <span class="red-text">walker</span>... well,
        walks!

      <h2>a <em>noisy</em> walker</h2>

      <p class="normal-text">
        We can use different random algorithms to control the behavior of our
        <span class="red-text">walker</span>. For example, instead of using a
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution"
          target="_blank"
          >uniform random distribution</a
        >, we could use something like
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise" target="_blank"
          >Perlin noise</a
        >, which generates smooter random values. The issue here is: how do we
        map the generated values to our 1D walker’s “direction”. One simple
        approach is to take the value generated by p5.js’
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noise" target="_blank"
          >noise()</a
        >
        and use p5.js’
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/map" target="_blank">map()</a>
        to smartly convert it to a number between -1 and 1. The issue here is
        that we we’ll generate a floating point number that is... well,
        <em>between</em> -1 and 1, and not either or.
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        Anoter - arguably dumber - approach, which we are gonna use here, is to
        instead use the generated number as a thresshold value. So, in our
        example, if the noise algorithm generates a number <= 0.5, the walker
        goes backwards; otherwise, it goes forward.
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        Try fiddling with the numbers! They do the same as in the previous
        iteration.

        Ok, that’s cool and all, but what about the creative visualizations? For
        this one, it is a bit more interesting. You see, since
        <span class="red-text">Perlin noise</span> generates
        <em>smooth</em> random values, more often than not, our
        <span class="red-text">walker</span> is gonna take a large sequence of
        steps in the same direction. Once again, let’s visualize the
        <span class="red-text">walker</span> in 2D, since a 1D
        <span class="red-text">walker</span> is pretty lame. This time, let’s

        Pretty interesting, right? You see that our

        taking some very smooth turns, which is expected since we’re using
        <span class="red-text">Perlin noise</span> to control its movements. It
        will be easier to spot this trend in the animated version below, but the

      <h2>what about... <em>more</em> walkers?</h2>

      <p class="normal-text">
        All we’ve done so far is working with one
        <span class="red-text">random walker</span> in a 1D or 2D space. For our
        creative visualizations, this is more than fine. Many
        <span class="red-text">walkers</span> at the same time can create some
        very cluttered monstrosities if we’re not careful (<em
          >but we’re not, so we’re gonna do it anyways</em
        >). You know what is it not fine for? Visualizing trends and
        distribution. A lone <span class="red-text">walker</span> doesn’t tell
        us much about the trends in this beautiful stochastic system. We need
        many <span class="red-text">replicates</span> if we want to understand
        the mechanism behind this phenomenom.
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        This time around, I’ll let you take a bit more control over our graph.
        You’ll again be able to choose the values for <em>N</em> and
        <em>r</em> and, alongside that, you’ll also control <em>w</em>, the
        number of <span class="red-text">walkers</span> (or
        <span class="red-text">replicates</span>), and what random algorithm to
        use (<em>random</em>, for an uniform distribution, or <em>noise</em>,

        Nice! With that many <span class="red-text">walkers</span>, we can see
        how the different random algorithms behave, and understand the
        <em>random</em> nature of the process. You know what else we can do?
        <em>Predict</em>! With a rather simple
        <a

          target="_blank"
          >mathematical approach</a

        total number of steps, <em>N</em>. Here’s the formula:

      <span class="formula">d = sqrt(N)</span>

      <p class="normal-text">
        Do note, though, that this is only true when we’re talking about a
        uniform <span class="red-text">random walker</span>, so it’s not gonna
        work for our noise <span class="red-text">walker</span>. Two other
        things must be taken in consideration: first, this formula describes the
        behavior of a 1D <span class="red-text">walker</span>, although it can
        be applied (with adjustments) to many dimensions; and second, it assumes
        a step size of 1. That second consideration can easily be circumvented
        by using a modified version of the formula, which includes <em>r</em> as
        a variable:
      </p>

      <span class="formula">d = r * sqrt(N)</span>

      <p class="normal-text">
        We talked a lot about <span class="red-text">random walks</span>, but
        not much about <em>what the heck</em> we can do with them. Now this is
        the part where I try to convince you that modelling
        <span class="red-text">random walks</span> can actually be quite useful.
        The best way to do this is with a
        <a

          >silly example</a

      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        To give you a primer, <span class="red-text">random walks</span> can be
        used to predict the variations of an event that are due to pure chance.
        This already sounds interesting and useful,
        <strong>but wait, there’s more</strong>!
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        By comparing a time series with a
        <span class="red-text">random walk</span>, for example, you can evaluate
        both distributions and, if you have enough data, understand if your
        distribution deviates significantly from a purely stochastic event. What
        that means is that <span class="red-text">random walks</span> might be
        able to tell if a certain event in time is
        <em>actually predictable</em> or so much influenced by chance alone (or
        almost)!
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        It is not hard to see a situation in which that’d be useful: think of a
        better. Our little friend, Mr. Walkerson, is an avid better and believes
        many of his decisions affect his outcomes. He deeply analyzes the games
        he can bet on, the teams’ latest performances and identifiable trends in
        a short time span. He’s not emotionally attached to any team, and he
        even uses a well-trained AI to assist him in his “predictions”.
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        Alright, so let’s say Mr. Walkerson wants to bet on Team Average, a
        pretty... average baseball team. Although the name might be a sign that
        Mr. Walkerson could be wrong in his belief of his prediction abilities,
        it is true that, in the last baseball season, Team Average had an
        outstanding record of <strong>10 consecutive wins</strong>! If that’s
        not a sign, then Mr. Walkerson doesn’t know what is! But seriously, he
        doesn’t...
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">Let me show you why, and then we’ll discuss it.</p>

      <span class="formula">d = 12...</span>

      <canvas id="chart-5" class="chart"></canvas>

      <p class="normal-text">
        Ok so, two questions, one answer: what does the formula and the graph
        above tell us about Team Average’s outstanding win streak and how can we
        use them to prove Mr. Walkerson can’t predict a thing?
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        The answer is simple, but first let’s describe what happened above.
        We’ll assume a standard U.S. baseball league season, which consists of a
        grand total of 162 games for each team. Our stars, Team Average, has a
        50% chance of winning each game and, when it wins, it gets +1 point (or
        takes a step of 1) and, when it loses, it gets -1 point (or takes a step
        of -1). According to our
        <span class="red-text">random walk</span> formula, an average team is
        expected to win or lose between 12 and 13 games
        <em>completely by chance</em>. This means that, instead of the expected
        average record of 81 wins, it is just as likely that Team Average
        actually wins 91 games out of a simple random variation!
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        What this tells us is that some events are
        <em>just too hard to predict</em>, and it’s not our fault. Randomness
        plays a bigger role than what we tend to believe in those events, which
        introduces a certain irreducible error, resulting in a bunch of noise in
        our predictions.
      </p>
      <p class="normal-text">
        So, unfortunately for Mr. Walkerson, he and his betting friends are
        better off just throwing a coin to decide in which team to bet on.
